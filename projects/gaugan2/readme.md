# GauGAN 2 images

These images were made by Jake Gustafson using GauGAN 2.

The [NVIDIA RESEARCH AI PLAYGROUND TERMS OF USE](term.txt) (originally from <http://gaugan.org/gaugan2/term.txt>, also called the "terms of use" below) grants the user, (the book author, Jake Gustafson in this case also called "the author" below), a non-exclusive non-transferable license to use and distribute the images created using GauGAN 2. See the document for the full terms of use. The terms apply to the user, not the person receiving the files (such as the person using this git repository or the book). However, the part above and possibly other parts of the terms of use apply to works created using the site. Therefore, the summary above is a best effort to communicate all restrictions that may affect the file license. The author believes that the license on the book's license page is compatible with the terms of use.
