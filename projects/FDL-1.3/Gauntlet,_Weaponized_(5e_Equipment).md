Rather than used solely for protection, a weaponized gauntlet is reinforced for punching attacks, and may feature small barbs or spikes on the knuckles. Suits of armor often incorporate one or two gauntlets like these.

_**Glove.**_ A glove weapon is worn on your hand or forearm, and you cannot be disarmed of it. You can hold objects, wield weapons, and cast spells with a hand fitted with a glove weapon, but you can only attack with the glove weapon if that hand is unoccupied.
