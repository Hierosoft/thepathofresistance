# Deep Dream Generator images

The images processed by deepdreamgenerator.com were created by Jake Gustafson using the site, with the following caveats:
- Hodnuch is based on an original drawing by Jake Gustafson processed by Face-Depixelizer which has (or had) no specific terms of use, so I claim the pre-deepdreamgenerator image as my work.
- The west pass is based on a hand-made composite of gaugan2 images (two landscape and 1 sky) (See [NVIDIA RESEARCH AI PLAYGROUND TERMS OF USE](../gaugan2/term.txt) originally from <http://gaugan.org/gaugan2/term.txt>).
