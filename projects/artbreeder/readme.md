## Rework
The included changelog files describe how each file was reworked, but
not every file that was reworked has a changelog. To see what rework
was done (usually the following are necessary by hand: improving the
outline artifacts, hands, and improving the eyes and/or face) compare
the image in this directory to the final image used in the book.
